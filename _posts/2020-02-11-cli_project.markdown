My first project during this course, I admit, had me on edge. My initial concern was me questioning myself about the different concepts we learned in this section and did I retain enough to successfully implement them. I them. Once I started the project I knew what techniques I wanted to use yet I was mixing them with others causing more confusion for myself. When I asked questions during the open office meeting the cohort lead would inform me that I am close to my desired result. Once we worked through it I found out that a lot of the times the final combination needed I had in a previous attempt. In other words, I had the correct pieces just not fitting them together in the correct combination. Even though I needed help it was encouraging to know at least I was on the correct path. This gave me the confidence to know I would make it through this first project. 
My CLI project is based on details for certain insects. Being that information I needed did not have a large list I used scraping on the website I used to gather the information. With that information complied them into hashes. I used those hashes to create a new instance of Class with their attributes already attached. Once I was able to get a functioning CLI operating I decided to add another insect to had depth and show that the CLI can be easily expandable. This project was challenging and yet rewarding once I had a fully functional CLI.
