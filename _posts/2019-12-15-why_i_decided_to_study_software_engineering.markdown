A brief yet detailed reason why I chose to study Software Engineering; where should I start?
My work background is in rooted in the hardware side of the industry. I worked in CO (central offices) installing the equipment needed to transport the information we utilize over the internet on a daily basis. After the collaspe of the company I worked for happened became focused on finding employment that was more stable when it came to job security. Thats when I started to work for a major cable company. After more than a decade with this company I had family circumtances that urged me to move back home. Now this major cable company which had offices where I needed to move did not allow me nor my 16 years of experience to transfer. At this point I realized my value to them. While contemplating my next move a came across some information about web development. That information, which at the time, looked intimidating was not totally confusing and it made sense after following along.  After further research it became clear to me that web development is comparable to contruction work. There will always be a need for new applications and the updating of outdated ones with the way technology is growing. The desire to learn a new skill and connect it with my past experience is a motivating factor on why i ~~want to~~ will become a software engineer. "
