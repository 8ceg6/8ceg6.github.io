A Boolean can be explained as information or data that when processed gives only one response. That response is implemented by the use true or false. This is a common approach when data needs to be sorted into groups based on particular factors or characteristics. In everyday day life we use Booleans in decision making. Mentally we say to ourselves “If this happens then I will do this, Else I will do that.” In coding that is how most Booleans are expressed in written form. There are symbols also associated with expressing how Booleans are expressed in visual form called Logical Operators. It is safe to say that understanding the use of Booleans are essential for building a solid foundation in writing effective code and returning the desired results.
